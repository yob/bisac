The Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) Group is a US body that
among other things, has defined a set of specifications for electronic data
exchange within the book industry.

This set of classes are just convenience wrappers around some of those formats,
designed to make reading and writing them a little less painful.

At this stage I've implemented support for 3 message types. See their classes for
specific documentation.

- Bisac::Message - Title metadata message
- Bisac::PO      - Purchase Order
- Bisac::POA     - Purchase Order Acknowledgement
