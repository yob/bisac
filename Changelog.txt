v0.6.1 (10th December, 2007)
- Fixed a silly bug (and added a spec) that prevented 10 digit ISBNs from being 
  recognised properly.

v0.6 (10th December, 2007)
- Added support for files that contain multiple POs.
  - This required a method to be deprecated. It still works for now, but a
    warning is printed to stderr
- Added support for the non-standard Pacstream extension that adds an ISBN13 field

v0.5 (3rd July, 2007)
- Initial Release
